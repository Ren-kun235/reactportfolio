            <p>
                I'm an aspiring coder working to learn more about HTML, CSS, Javascript and many other coding languages.
                Some of the many activites I enjoy doing are fishing, camping, gaming, and sports.
                I want to learn coding because I wanted to change careers and enjoy doing it at the same time.
                Please take a look around my web portfolio!
